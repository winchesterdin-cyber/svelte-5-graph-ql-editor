# agents.md

Guidelines for agents (and contributors) working on this repository.
Primary goal: stability and correctness.

---

## Priorities

1. Keep existing behavior working.
2. Prefer small, safe changes over large rewrites.
3. Treat errors/warnings as failures unless explicitly justified.
4. Add tests for real behavior; fix failures immediately.

---

## Local development database (testing-friendly)

- Use a local, disposable DB for development/testing (SQLite preferred, or an equivalent lightweight option).
- Provide a simple way to reset it:
  - delete existing local DB
  - apply schema/migrations
  - load deterministic seed data
- Keep production DB configuration unchanged.

---

## Required testing approach

Run checks in a consistent order:

1. Formatting / lint / type checks (if applicable)
2. Unit tests
3. Integration tests (API + DB)
4. End-to-end tests (browser)

Minimum expectations:

- Tests cover core flows (not placeholder tests).
- E2E tests must watch for:
  - terminal errors
  - browser console errors
  - failing network requests (unless expected)

---

## Failure protocol (mandatory)

If anything fails (build, tests, runtime):

1. Reproduce locally.
2. Fix the root cause (not a workaround).
3. Add/adjust tests to prevent regression.
4. Refactor to reduce fragility when appropriate.
5. Re-run the full test sequence and verify logs.

---

## Logging rules

- Terminal output must not contain unexpected errors or warnings.
- Browser console must not contain errors in normal flows.

---

## Refactoring rules (stability-first)

- Refactor only to improve reliability, clarity, and testability.
- Avoid non-determinism in tests (real time, randomness, ordering assumptions).
- Keep validation and error handling consistent.

---

## Definition of done

A change is done only if:

- App runs locally using the disposable dev DB.
- Automated checks and tests pass.
- No unexpected terminal errors/warnings.
- No browser console errors in core usage paths.
- Relevant behavior is covered by tests.
